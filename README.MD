## Description

A Python utility for malware detection using YARA rules. It leverages the YARA Python library and yarac for in-memory rule handling, optimized binary compilation, and efficient file scanning, offering faster and more reliable results than traditional Bash scripting.

## Requirements

- Python3
- Yara C Library
- Yara-Python Library
- TQDM Python Library

## Installation for macOS

#### 1. Add ~/bin/ to `PATH`:

```
mkdir ~/bin/
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # Or ~/.zshrc if using Zsh
source ~/.bashrc  # Or ~/.zshrc
```

#### 2. Install Yara C Library

```
brew install yara
```

#### 3. Create Python Virtual Environment

```
mkdir ~/bin/scan_env
source ~/bin/scan_env/bin/activate
pip install yara-python tqdm
deactivate
```

#### 4. Download and edit scan files

1. Download `scan` and `scan.py` to `~/bin/`.
2. Edit `scan.py` and edit the line `BASE_DIR = os.path.expanduser('/path/to/yara/rules')`, replacing `/path/to/yara/rules` with the path to your YARA rules.
3. Make `scan` executable by running `chmod +x ~/bin/scan`

## Usage

Run the script using the `scan` command. The script supports scanning directories, specific files, or defaults to the current working directory.

1. **Scan the Current Working Directory (Default)**: `scan`

2. **Scan a Specific Directory**: `scan -d /path/to/directory`

3. **Scan Specific Files**: `scan -f file1.php file2.html`

#### Note:

This scans all files in the current working directory or the specified directory/file. To ensure accurate results, limit the scan to binary files.

Example Output:

```
